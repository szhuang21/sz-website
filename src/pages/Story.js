            My journey into computer science began humbly when my parents made me do Khan Academy at
            the library as a kid. I quickly grew bored of the pre-algebra problems I was assigned,
            and then stumbled upon the Intro to JavaScript tutorial. The first challenge was to draw
            a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù snowman using JavaScript. Despite my stubborn efforts, it was a ~struggle.
            When I finally saw the 3 circles neatly fall into place, I was more satisfied that
            I&apos;d finished the problem than amazed by what I&apos;d done. Unfortunately, this
            snowman wasn&apos;t quite the &quot;Hello World!&quot; moment I was hoping for in the
            world of CS. I did a couple more of the challenges, but gave up once the challenges
            started asking me to animate the circles.

            Fast forward to high school, where I took AP Computer Science. Despite my initial
            enthusiasm, I soon found myself looking for excuses to leave class early, whether it was
            for a golf tournament or golf practice. I scraped by that class doing the bare minimum,
            feeling imposter syndrome creep up my neck with every new concept we learned. (I realize
            I‚Äôm making it seem like I love anything but coding, but I&apos;m getting to my point I
            promise)

          <div className="text-base text-left pt-8 font-montserrat text-gray-700">
            My journey in CS has been a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs, ebbs and flows.
            It&apos;s been a consistent cycle of trying it out because it seemed interesting, giving
            up because it was too difficult, and then being lured back in again and again. Before my
            freshman year of college, I re-learned what we had been taught in AP Computer Science so
            that I could proficiency out of the intro sequence class at UIUC. Learning at my own
            pace allowed me to appreciate the logic and complexity of code in a whole new way, and
            much to my surprise, I passed the proficiency test. Proficiencying out of CS124 was both
            the best and worst decision I&apos;ve ever made. The first semester was an absolute time
            !! I went from writing print statements in BlueJ to managing dynamic memory and using
            DFS to navigate graphs in C++. I joined a couple of CS clubs, learned how to use GitHub
            for the first time, helped create a website for startups on campus using React, kind of
            built a Discord chat bot, and did a ton of discrete math.

          <div className="text-base text-left pt-8 font-montserrat text-gray-700">
            At first, I was extremely lost and struggled to keep up with all the new terminology and
            concepts. But eventually, I got used to the feeling of being in unfamiliar territory and
            started to worry less about not knowing everything, and instead on what I could learn.
            This mindset shift was a game-changer for me because once I admitted to myself that I
            didn&apos;t know shit, I became more open to learning, asking for help, and exploring
            new ideas.

            After doing a few projects Freshmen year like Sp-ART-ify, a website that turns someone‚Äôs
            music taste into art, I started to get the hang out things. I interned at Liberty Mutual
            Insurance in Seattle over the summer. I picked up new skills in the industry but more
            importantly, I spent a summer building out various passion projects with my friends. I
            was pushed to pick up new technologies from Figma to Tailwind to JUnit to NodeJS, and
            realized that the state of discomfort that I felt before learning something new was a
            sign of room to grow. I built a web scraper that combines all of Liberty Mutual‚Äôs
            platform&apos;s search results into 1 search engine and a website that takes in a spoken
            phrase and uses NLP and sentiment analysis to transform it into a mood based Spotify
            playlist.

          <div className="text-base text-left pt-8 font-montserrat text-gray-700">
            With each project I built, I gained more experience and open-mindedness to learn more.
            Today, I foster my passion for coding by building software solutions for non-profits as
            a software developer and product manager lead at Hack4Impact (H4I) and teach freshmen
            how to build their own projects as a Course Assistant for CS124 Honors. Overall, my
            journey in CS has been one of growth and discovery, and I am eager and passionate to
            continue learning more. As I&apos;m navigating through the field, I&apos;ve realized how
            much I truly love coding. I strive to create meaningful, empathetic, and user-oriented
            solutions that will change the world.
